This is my first portfolio website.  I used HTML and CSS to create this.  I used hovereffects over each of the pieces of work and made very good use of CSS grid.  Each subpage is laid out the same grid to format the description.  I also used grids for the formatting my image gallery as well as the header box on the homepage.  My first version of this website was shown in the CVPA Festival of Light and Fashion show at our web typography booth.  I got feedback in the form of a google form and made changes accordingly.  I created subpages for each of the works as well as making the moving background less pixelated.  It was a struggle to have so many svgs and files within this website while keeping the overall file size down.  There were a lot of rounds of minimizing files for all of my svgs in order to keep the background file large and less pixelated.
